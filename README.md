# Social_Distancing_with_AI
This project aims at monitoring people violating Social Distancing over video footage coming from CCTV Cameras. Uses YOLOv3 along with DBSCAN clustering for recognizing potential intruders. A Face Mask Classifier model (Resnet50) is trained and deployed for identifying people not wearing a face mask. Augmented masked faces are generated using facial landmarks for aiding the training process.

A detailed description of this project along with the results can be found [here](#project-description-and-results).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Running this project on your local system requires the following packages to be installed :

* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* PIL
* cv2
* keras 
* face_detection
* face_recognition
* tqdm

They can be installed from the Python Package Index using pip as follows :
 
     pip install numpy
     pip install matplotlib
     pip install sklearn
     pip install Pillow
     pip install opencv-python
     pip install Keras
     pip install face-detection
     pip install face-recognition
     pip install tqdm
     
You can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in a Web Browser with most of the libraries preinstalled.
 
### Usage
This project is implemented using interactive Jupyter Notebooks. You just need to open the notebook on your local system or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and execute the code cells in sequential order. The function of each code cell is properly explained with the help of comments.

Please download the following files (from the given links) and place them in the Models folder in the root directory :
1. YOLOv3 weights : https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
2. Face Mask Classifier ResNet50 Keras Model : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q59338kd463UqUESwgt7aF_W46Fj5OJd?usp=sharing

Also before starting you need to make sure that the path to various files and folders in the notebook are updated according to your working environment. If you are using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), then :
1. Mount Google Drive using : 

        from google.colab import drive
        drive.mount('drive/')
        
2. Update file/folder locations as `'drive/path_to_file_or_folder'`.
