# Social_Distancing_with_AI
This project aims at monitoring people violating Social Distancing over CCTV footage during these tough COVID19 times. It uses YOLOv3 for localizing the intruders. A face mask classifier model (Resnet50) is trained on augmented masked faces (using face landmarks) for finding people not wearing a face mask.
